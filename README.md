# Blockchain-Python
A simple blockchain project in Python. Not very useful, just used to learn some more complex python.

Basic foundation of a blockchain with the following features:

-Proof of work

-Chain verification

-Transaction signing

-Consensus between nodes with conflict handling

-Online UI

-API developed with Flask

Dependencies: I suggest you use ANACONDA to install

-Flask

-Flask-CORS

-PyCrypto

-Requests

Run the node.py file to start blockchain and access interface with localhos:5000 in the browser. -p can be used to specify a port.
